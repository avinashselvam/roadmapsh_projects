### What is this repo?

Having been an ML Engineer for the past few years I haven't directly dealt with backend systems such as servers, databases, caches etc.

While I'm familiar with them I want to understand them in a much deeper manner.

To have hands on experience, I am building a bunch of projects mentioned in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas)
